# tt-installer
Install the tenstorrent software stack with one command.

## Quickstart
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/releases/latest/download/install.sh)"
```
**WARNING:** Take care with this command! Always be careful running untrusted code.

## Using tt-metalium
In addition to our system-level tools, this script installs tt-metalium, Tenstorrent's framework for building and running AI models. Metalium is installed as a container using Podman. You have two container options, both of which can be installed:
- tt-metalium container (default): 1GB, appropriate for using TT-NN
- tt-metalium Model Demos Container (experimental!): 10GB, includes a full build of tt-metalium

Using the containers is easy- just run `tt-metalium` or `tt-metalium-models`. By default, this will launch the container with your home directory mounted so you can access your files. You can also run `tt-metalium <command>` to run commands inside the container, such as `tt-metalium "python3"`.

For more about Metalium and TTNN, check out the [examples page](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metal/latest/ttnn/ttnn/usage.html#basic-examples). For more information about the container, see [this page](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/wiki/Using-the-tt%E2%80%90metalium-container) on the wiki.

## Using Python Tools
tt-installer installs two Python tools on your system:
1. tt-smi: Tenstorrent's System Management Interface
2. tt-flash: Utility to update your firmware

Running `tt-smi` launches the interface where you can see your hardware status and confirm the install worked properly.

## Full List of Functions
tt-installer performs the following actions on your system:
1. Using your package manager, installs base packages the software stack depends on
2. Configures a Python environment to install Python packages
3. Installs tenstorrent's Kernel-Mode Driver (KMD)
4. Installs tt-flash and updates your card's firmware
5. Configures HugePages, which are necessary for fast access to your Tenstorrent hardware
6. Installs tt-smi, our System Management Interface
7. Using your package manager, installs Podman
8. Installs tt-metalium as a Podman container and configures the tt-metalium script for convenient access to it

The installer will ask the user to make choices about Python environments and tt-metalium. If you wish to configure the installation more granularly, see [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage).

## Advanced Usage
The installer supports command-line arguments for customization. For a full list of available arguments and their environment variable equivalents, please see [this page](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/wiki/Customizing-your-installation) on the wiki.

To install from a local file, download the latest install.sh:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-installer/releases/latest/download/install.sh -O
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

To see all available options:
```bash
./install.sh --help
```

To install without prompting the user:
```bash
./install.sh --mode-non-interactive
```

To skip certain components:
```bash
./install.sh --no-install-kmd --no-install-hugepages
```

To specify versions:
```bash
./install.sh --kmd-version=1.34 --fw-version=18.3.0
```

Note that the installer requires superuser (sudo) permisssions to install packages, add DKMS modules, and configure hugepages.

## Supported Operating Systems
Our preferred OS is Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). Other operating systems will not be prioritized for support or features.
For more information, please see this compatibility matrix:
| OS     | Version     | Working? | Notes                                     |
